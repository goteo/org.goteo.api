/**
 * AccountingTransactions represent a movement of money from one Accounting (origin) into another (target).\
 * \
 * When a transaction targets an Accounting it means that the Accounting receives it, this will add to that Accounting.
 * When a transaction originates from an Accounting the Accounting issues the transaction and it will deduct from it if,
 * specially when the transaction comes from a GatewayCharge processed by the `wallet` Gateway.\
 * \
 * AccountingTransactions are generated for each GatewayCharge in a GatewayCheckout once it becomes successful.
